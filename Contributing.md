# Contributions Welcome

If you'd like to submit a contribution to this testing comparison, please do! In particular, I'm interested in contributions that enhance the testing methodology to further verify or challenge the given results.

PRs that do so are welcome! When submitting a pull request, please do two things:

- update the Readme.md with the output of your results
- add your tests in a new Apex class file with your name and "_Tests.cls" - if I was contributing, I would make a file "jamessimone_Tests.cls" and it's associated metadata file.
